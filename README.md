# Holberton School Low Level Programming
This repository was created with educational purpose. The content of the directory is introduction to c language and getting familiar with the concepts. 

## Q & A

1. Who invented C?
     
     C, computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist Dennis M. Richie at Bell Laboratories. 
     

2. Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kerninghan and Linus Torvald?

     The cevelopers of UNIX.

3. What happens when you type gcc main.c?

     It creates an out file, which is a compiled executable file. With the out file, you can then run the program. And that would be all in the compilation process.
    
    4. What is a entry point?
     
     An entry point is a location where a transfer of a program control occurs.

5. What is main?

     Is a predefined keyword or function in c. It is the first function of every C program that is responsible for starting the execution and termination of the program.

6. What is the default program name when compiling with gcc?

     By default, gcc assumes that you want to create an executable program called a.exe.
     
### Table of Content 

1. Hello_world = introduction to C language and simple proyects.

2. Variables if, else, while
     if: is a condition statement that, if proved true, perform a funcion or displays information.
     else: is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous test conditions evaluates to false.
     while: while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific conidition is met.
     variable: Location where we store data.

3. Function, nested loops
    function: is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    nested loops: It allows the looping of statements inside another loops.

4. Makefiles = sets a set of rules to determine which part of the program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. Makefiles is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex task with dependencies. 

5. Pointers, Arrays & Strings
     Pointers: is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
     Arrays: is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
     Strings: are arrays of character terminated by a null character.
     
 6. Recursion = Allows any of it function to call itself multiple times in a program. Here, any function that happen to call itself again and again, unless the program satifies some specific condition is called a recursive function.
 
 7. Static Libraries = is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
 
 8. Argc & Argv
 
     argc: refers to the number of arguments passed
     
     argv: is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program
     
 9.  Malloc, Free:
 
     Malloc: separetes memory and return a pointer to it.
     
     Free: free up the memory allocated by malloc at the end of the program.
 
 10. Preprocessor = is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.

11. Structures & Typedef
     Structure: are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
     
     Typedef: Is a keywaord used to provide some meaningful name to the already existing varaible in the program.

12. Variadic Functions = are functions which take a variable number of arguments.
