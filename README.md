# Holberton School Low Level Programming
This repository was created with educational purpose. The content of the directory is introduction to c language and getting familiar with the command. 

## Q & A

1. Who invented C?
     
     C, computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist Dennis M. Richie at Bell Laboratories. 
     

2. Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kerninghan and Linus Torvald?

     The cevelopers of UNIX.

3. What happens when you type gcc main.c?

     It creates an out file, which is a compiled executable file. With the out file, you can then run the program. And that would be all in the compilation process.
    
    4. What is a entry point?
     
     An entry point is a location where a transfer of a program control occurs.

5. What is main?

     Is a predefined keyword or function in c. It is the first function of every C program that is responsible for starting the execution and termination of the program.

6. What is the default program name when compiling with gcc?

     By default, gcc assumes that you want to create an executable program called a.exe.
     
### Table of Content 

1. Hello_world = introduction to C language and simple proyects.

2. Variables if, else, while
     if: is a condition statement that, if proved true, perform a funcion or displays information.
     else: is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous test conditions evaluates to false.
     while: while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific conidition is met.
     variable: Location where we store data.

3. Function, nested loops
    function: is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    nested loops: It allows the looping of statements inside another loops.

4. Makefiles = sets a set of rules to determine which part of the program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. Makefiles is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex task with dependencies. 

5. Pointers, Arrays & Strings
     Pointers: is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
     Arrays: is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
     Strings: are arrays of character terminated by a null character.
