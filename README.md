# Holberton School Low Level Programming
Welcome to the Holberton School Low Level Programming repository! This repository contains code examples and projects related to low-level programming. 

## About Holberton School
Holberton School is a project-based alternative to college for the next generation of software engineers. The curriculum focuses on full-stack software engineering and covers low-level programming, higher-level programming, DevOps, and more.

## About Low Level Programming
Low-level programming involves writing code that is closer to machine language than higher-level programming languages like Python or JavaScript. This includes using assembly language and C programming language to write code that directly interfaces with hardware.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains various projects related to low-level programming. The content of this repository are organized by directories, each containing a specific project. Here is an overview of the directories:

1. Hello_world = Simple code example demonstrating how to print text to the console usign the printf() function.

2. Variables, if, else, while = Code examples demonstrating how to use variables and conditional statements in C programming.

3. Function, nested loops = Code examples demonstrating how to use variables and conditional statement in C programming.

4. Makefiles = sets a set of rules to determine which part of the program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. Makefiles is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex task with dependencies. 

5. Pointers, Arrays & Strings = Code examples demonstrating how to use pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. 

6. Recursion = Code examples demonstrating how to use recursion on C programming.

7. Static Libraries = Code example demonstrating how to create and use static libraries in C programming.

8. Argc & Argv = Code examples demonstrating how to use command line arguments in C programming.

9. Malloc, Free = Code examples demonstrating how to use dynamic memory allocation in C programming.

10. Preprocessor = Code examples demonstrating how to use preprocessor in C programming.

11. Structures & Typedef = Code examples demonstrating how to use structures and typedefs in C programming. 

12. Variadic Functions = Code example demonstrating how to use variadic functions in C programming.

13. Singly Linked Lists = Code examples implementing singly linked lists data structures and operations on them.

14. Bit Manipulation = Code examples of bit manipulation, bitwise operator and binary representation in low-level programming using the C language.

15. File I/O = Code examples related to file input/output operations in C programming.

16. Doubly Linked Lists = Code examples of Doubly linked lists in C programming.

17. Hash Tables = Code examples of hash tables in C programming.

Thanks you for visiting the Holberton School Low Level Programming repository! Hope that the code example demonstrates in this repository will be helpful in your software engineering journey.
