# Holberton School Low Level Programming
This repository was created with educational purpose. The content of the directory is introduction to c language and getting familiar with the concepts. 

### Table of Content 

1. ![Hello_world](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/hello_world) = introduction to C language and simple proyects.

2. ![Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/variables_if_else_while)

     if: is a condition statement that, if proved true, perform a funcion or displays information.
     
     else: is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous test conditions evaluates to false.
     
     while: while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific conidition is met.
     
     variable: Location where we store data.

3. ![Function, nested loops](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/functions_nested_loops)

    function: is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    
    nested loops: It allows the looping of statements inside another loops.

4. ![Makefiles](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/makefiles) = sets a set of rules to determine which part of the program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. Makefiles is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex task with dependencies. 

5. ![Pointers, Arrays & Strings](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/pointers_arrays_strings)

     Pointers: is a variable whose value is the address of another variable.
     
     Arrays: is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
     
     Strings: are arrays of character terminated by a null character.
     
 6. ![Recursion](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/recursion) = Allows any of it function to call itself multiple times in a program. Here, any function that happen to call itself again and again, unless the program satifies some specific condition is called a recursive function.
 
 7. ![Static Libraries](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/static_libraries) = is a compiled object file containing all symbols required by the main program to operate as opposed to having to pull in separate entities.
 
 8. ![Argc & Argv](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/argc_argv)
 
     argc: refers to the number of arguments passed
     
     argv: is a pointer array which points to each argument passed to the program
     
 9.  ![Malloc, Free](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/malloc_free)
 
     Malloc: separetes memory and return a pointer to it.
     
     Free: free up the memory allocated by malloc at the end of the program.
 
 10. ![Preprocessor](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/preprocessor) = is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.

11. ![Structures & Typedef](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/structures_typedef)

     Structure: are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
     
     Typedef: Is a keywaord used to provide some meaningful name to the already existing varaible in the program.

12. ![Variadic Functions](https://github.com/Lizz3108/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/variadic_functions) = are functions which take a variable number of arguments.

13. Singly Linked Lists
14. Bit Manipulation
15. File I/O
16. Doubly Linked Lists
17. Hash Tables
